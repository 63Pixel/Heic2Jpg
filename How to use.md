# Heic2Jpg
Converts HEIC images to JPG
Start the script in the folder where the HEIC images are located. 
All HEIC images in the folder will then be converted to JPG format. 
At the same time, a JPG folder is created and the images copied into it.

The .heic files can be HEIC or heic, it doesnÂ´t matter.
